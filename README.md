# Prosperity Trading Challenge

Welcome to the Prosperity Trading Challenge! This project is set in a near-utopian future where I control an island in an archipelago. My goal is to bring my island to prosperity by earning as many SeaShells, the main currency in the archipelago, as possible over a 15-day trading challenge.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Development of Algorithmic Trading Strategy
I developed a Python script to handle algorithmic trades. This involved:
- **Analyzing Market Data**: Processing and analyzing historical and real-time market data to identify trading opportunities.
- **Implementing Trading Algorithms**: Creating and fine-tuning algorithms to execute trades automatically based on predefined criteria.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Continuously monitoring and optimizing the trading strategy to maximize SeaShell earnings.

### 2. Manual Trading Challenges
In addition to algorithmic trading, I participated in daily manual trading challenges. These tasks included:
- **Decision Making**: Making quick, informed decisions based on current market conditions.
- **Interactive Trading**: Engaging with interactive prompts to manually execute trades.
- **Performance Feedback**: Receiving real-time feedback on my trading decisions to refine my strategies.

### 3. Balancing Strategies
I balanced both algorithmic and manual trading strategies to ensure optimal performance:
- **Integration**: Ensuring that the Python script for algorithmic trading complemented my manual trading efforts.
- **Adaptation**: Adapting strategies based on feedback and changing market conditions to maximize earnings.

## Conclusion

The Prosperity Trading Challenge tested my trading abilities through a combination of automated and manual tasks. By developing a robust algorithmic trading strategy and actively engaging in manual trading challenges, I led my island to prosperity and achieved positive SeaShell earnings!
